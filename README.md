## [EEG P300 Wave Detection](EEG_P300_Waveform_FSM/)

EEG FSM P300 module is a Finite State Machine (FSM) designed to detect a P300 pattern from an input EEG signal based on pre defined thresholds and timing constraints.

## [Mealy Moore FSMs](MealyMoore_FSMs/)

A Template used to practicate Mealy and Moore FSMs (Given as Assignment to code 1011, 1101 and 10010 Sequence Detectors in Verilog)
